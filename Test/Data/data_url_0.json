        "title": "It's Immoral For Hamas To Use Human Shields And Immoral For Israel To Bomb Human Shields.",
        "description": "If the title of this article is vapid to the point of absurdity, that's because it is indeed a trite and possibly ludicrous way to describe the bloodshed in Gaza. Sadly, it's the truth, and the reality that both Hamas and Israel are to blame for the civilian deaths in Gaza is something neither side wants to admit; lest they come face to face with the frightening moral consequences of their military and political objectives. The death toll is overwhelmingly lopsided, as evident by the 1,047 Palestinians and close to 50 Israelis who have died since the beginning of the chaos. However, the asymmetric nature of the conflict is fueled by two military actors knowing very well that civilians will be caught in their crossfire. To blame one side without looking at the other is not only irresponsible, but borders on an overt attempt at circumventing the facts. Terror groups will never win a state for millions of people, Israel will never destroy the word \"terror\" or evade culpability for the suffering of Palestinians under its jurisdiction, and Gaza's occupation is legitimized by extremists on both sides. \n\nYes, the occupation of Gaza has caused tremendous suffering among Palestinians. As Muhammad Suliman eloquently describes in From Gaza: I Would Rather Die in Dignity Than Agree to Living in an Open-Air Prison, the human beings inhabiting Gaza deserve to live free and without immediate death from airstrikes that killed all 25 members of one family and 18 members of another family. The horror of such numbers, especially when taking a moment to remember that words on a page actually correlate to human beings who've once laughed, lived, and loved, will cause anyone a moment of pause. However, international relations often times runs by a cold calculus of reciprocity. In this case, the reciprocal relationship between a terrorist group and a country intent on preventing any addition to the 2,495 Israelis who've died in terrorist attacks. \n\nFirst, there's the notion among some people that Hamas's use of human shields is a myth. The reality is that Amnesty International has already stated, \"In previous conflicts Amnesty International has documented that Palestinian armed groups have stored munitions in and fired indiscriminate rockets from residential areas in the Gaza Strip in violation of international humanitarian law. Reports have also emerged during the current conflict of Hamas urging residents to ignore Israeli warnings to evacuate.\" Furthermore, Amnesty International (while vehemently urging Israel to cease military activities) has stated Hamas is violating international law by storing rockets in civilian areas and urging people not to leave their homes after being warned by Israel of impending attacks: \n\nAs explained above, in previous conflicts Amnesty International has documented that Palestinian armed groups have stored munitions in and fired indiscriminate rockets from residential areas in the Gaza Strip, and available evidence indicates that they continue to do both during the current hostilities, in violation of international humanitarian law. During the current hostilities, Hamas spokespeople have reportedly urged residents in some areas of the Gaza Strip not to leave their homes after the Israeli military dropped leaflets and made phone calls warning people in the area to evacuate.\n\n\nAmnesty International has also declared, \"Hamas has also continued to fire hundreds of indiscriminate rockets into Israel in violation of international law, killing two Israeli civilians and injuring others.\" \n\nIn addition, UNRWA in UNRWA CONDEMNS PLACEMENT OF ROCKETS, FOR A SECOND TIME, IN ONE OF ITS SCHOOLS states unequivocally that Hamas stores rockets in civilian centers:\n\nToday, in the course of the regular inspection of its premises, UNRWA discovered rockets hidden in a vacant school in the Gaza Strip.\n\n...UNRWA strongly and unequivocally condemns the group or groups responsible for this flagrant violation of the inviolability of its premises under international law.\n\nIt isn't a myth that Hamas hides rockets in civilian centers; it's a reality that UNRWA and the IDF know all too well. \n\nThat being said, Palestinians civilians do not deserve their current fate, but the reality is that Hamas is indeed hiding its weapons in civilian centers. To absolve this organization from culpability in the death of its people is to ignore its penchant for launching and hiding rockets and history of suicide attacks. Further bolstering the IDF's incentive for overwhelming force is the Hamas charter which states, \"Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.\" If you believe Israel is entirely to blame for the mayhem, then remember that Hamas's charter, its rockets, its suicide attacks, and its foreign donors undermine completely the just cause of Palestinian statehood. \n\nAs for Israel's response to the military threats posed by Hamas, there exists the reality that it could refrain from attacking densely populated areas. True, it's doubtful other nations would avoid retaliating against rocket attacks, but the issue of civilian deaths and suffering, along with disproportionate uses of force are very relevant. The morality of Israel's current campaign is questionable, especially since a great percentage of causalities are Palestinian young and children. According to CNN on July 29, civilian deaths continued to increase from Israeli air raids:\n\nEighteen people died as powerful and continuous air strikes rained down on Gaza City early Tuesday morning, the Palestinian Health Authority reported...\n\nTen people, including eight children, were killed Monday when shells hit a refugee camp near the beach in Gaza...\n\n\"In the blink of an eye,\" a father said, \"I found body parts and heads cut off, no arms, no legs. I started to collect limbs, heads I couldn't recognize, I couldn't recognize my own children.\"\n\nU.N. and Palestinian officials said 16 people were killed and hundreds were wounded Thursday when the school in northern Gaza was struck.\n\nIsrael should think not only of the global outrage elicited by the deaths of civilians in Gaza, but also of its own moral claim of defense. A country cannot simultaneously declare the moral high ground while the body parts of children are scattered across beaches and air strikes destroy hospitals. \n\nIn addition, there exists the legal issue of human rights violations; specifically the issue of bombing densely populated civilian locations. According to Human Rights Watch, attacking areas known to inhabit civilians in Gaza violates various international laws:\n\nIsraeli air attacks in Gaza investigated by Human Rights Watch have been targeting apparent civilian structures and killing civilians in violation of the laws of war...\n\n\"Israel's rhetoric is all about precision attacks but attacks with no military target and many civilian deaths can hardly be considered precise,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \"Recent documented cases in Gaza sadly fit Israel's long record of unlawful airstrikes with high civilian casualties.\"\n\n\nKnowingly attacking areas where women and children inhabit, even with leaflets warning impending bombings, is not how a war should be waged. \n\nFinally, Israel could decide to engage in defending its nation through means that don't create a disproportionate death toll upon Palestinian women, children, and families. As stated by former Israeli air force officer Yuli Novak in her Guardian article,When I served, the Israeli military was the most moral in the world. No more., even former Israeli soldiers are shocked at the recent military campaign:\n\nI know how hard it is to ask questions during times of conflict as a soldier. The information that the officers get in real time is always partial. That's why the responsibility for drawing the red lines, and alerting when we cross it, lies with the public.\n\nA clear, loud voice that says that bombing a house with civilians in it is immoral must be heard. These killings cannot be accepted without question. Public silence in the face of such actions - inside and outside of Israel - is consent by default, and acceptance of an unacceptable price.\n\nLike Novak states, it is indeed immoral to knowingly bomb a house filled with people, and no amount of \"ticking time bomb\" scenarios warrants such breach of conduct. \n\nThe arguments beginning with \"He started it\" don't work anymore, especially since both Hamas and Israel have thrown moral and acceptable standards of behavior out the window. The sooner that Palestinian and Israeli advocates deal with the momentary crisis of rockets, human shields, and alternate ways of warfare that don't target civilians, the sooner that human lives will be saved from tragedy.",

Public silence in the face of such actions - inside and outside of Israel - is consent by default, and acceptance of an unacceptable price.</blockquote><br />\n<br />\nLike Novak states, it is indeed immoral to knowingly bomb a house filled with people, and no amount of \"ticking time bomb\" scenarios warrants such breach of conduct. <br />\n<br />\nThe arguments beginning with \"He started it\" don't work anymore, especially since both Hamas and Israel have thrown moral and acceptable standards of behavior out the window. The sooner that Palestinian and Israeli advocates deal with the momentary crisis of rockets, human shields, and alternate ways of warfare that don't target civilians, the sooner that human lives will be saved from tragedy.",

        "description": "If  the U.S. Senate race in Iowa between state Sen. Joni Ernst (R) and Rep. Bruce Braley (D) has one defining feature, it&#8217;s not that polls show a statistical dead heat, but it&#8217;s that one of the candidates is straight up off her rocker in a way that Sarah Palin couldn&#8217;t even begin to comprehend. Joan Walsh suggests Ernst is this year&#8217;s Todd Akin, but even this gives her too much credit. While Akin has said many dumb things about the same subject (rape), Ernst says many dumb things about many subjects.\nWe were reminded of Ernst&#8217;s buffoonery on Tuesday, when The Daily Beast obtained video showing her speaking last year in front of the Iowa Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition, where she advocated nullification.\n\n“You know we have talked about this at the state legislature before, nullification. But, bottom line is, as U.S. Senator why should we be passing laws that the states are considering nullifying? Bottom line: our legislators at the federal level should not be passing those laws. We’re right…we’ve gone 200-plus years of federal legislators going against the Tenth Amendment’s states’ rights. We are way overstepping bounds as federal legislators. So, bottom line, no we should not be passing laws as federal legislators — as senators or congressman — that the states would even consider nullifying. Bottom line.”\nI&#8217;m tempted to think she meant bottom of the barrel line, because that&#8217;s exactly where this word casserole is coming from.\nHere&#8217;s a bottom line: the idea that states can &#8220;nullify&#8221; federal laws (i.e., ignore them) is dead, having been settled by the Supremacy Clause in the  Constitution, and then affirmed in the Civil War, as well by subsequent legislation and caselaw. Bottom line.\nYou can also tell from her remarks that she really struggled to articulate her position. The redundancy of her words (&#8220;bottom line,&#8221; &#8220;federal legislators&#8221;) as well as a fundamental misunderstanding of what she&#8217;s talking about (nullification), is usually a dead giveaway that someone&#8217;s reached the end of the well in terms of their understanding of an issue. Yet this is basic American civics.\nBut this is only the latest in string of falsehoods, gaffes, flubs, and crazy statements from Ernst. To wit:\n- In January she called President Obama &#8220;a dictator&#8221; who should be impeached and (possibly) removed from office.\n- In March she ran a campaign ad that began,\n\n&#8220;I&#8217;m Joni Ernst. I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm.&#8221;\n- In May, she doubted the science pointing to climate change.\n- Later in May, she told the Des Moines Register, &#8220;I have reason to believe there was weapons of mass destruction (sic)&#8221; in Iraq.\n- Later in May, she described Elliot Rodger&#8217;s killing spree at the University of California-Santa Barbara as an &#8220;unfortunate accident,&#8221; while simultaneously touting her gun cred by noting that she&#8217;d been endorsed by the NRA. This also occurred after she released an ad in which she fires a gun, an act which at this point has become a standard GOP campaign meme.\n- In June, she was forced to say publicly that she was &#8220;appalled&#8221; by Facebook posts by her husband, including, &#8220;What do you do if you see your ex running around in your front yard screaming and bloody? Stay calm. Reload. And try again.&#8221; Another post said of then Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, &#8220;And am I suppose (sic) to give up my guns? As if! Traitorous skank!&#8221;\nWith three full months before the general election, which will include a few debates with her Democratic opponent and unscripted Q&amp;As with the public, it will be a miracle if Ernst makes it through without imploding à la Todd Akin or Richard Mourdock.

        "title": "Israel Calls Up 16,000 More Reservists",
        "description": "Israel&#39;s military called up an additional 16,000 additional reservists, taking their total to 86,000, as military operations in the Gaza Strip continue, an army spokeswoman said Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;The army has issued 16,000 additional mobilization orders to allow troops on the ground to rest, which takes the total number of reservists to 86,000,&quot; said the spokeswoman, according to the French news agency AFP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsrael&#39;s security cabinet, which met for five hours Wednesday, unanimously decided to pursue attacks against Hamas &quot;terrorist targets&quot; and other operations to destroy a network of tunnels used by the Islamist movement between Gaza and Israel, public radio said.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother meeting of the cabinet, which comprises eight ministers, will be held Thursday afternoon, the radio added.\r\n\r\n\r\nDestroying tunnels\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Israel pressed ahead with its Gaza offensive saying it was days from achieving its core goal of destroying all Islamist guerrilla cross-border attack tunnels, but a soaring Palestinian civilian toll has triggered international alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s security cabinet on Wednesday approved continuing the assault, Israel also sent a delegation to Egypt, which has been trying, with Washington&#39;s blessing, to broker a cease-fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nGaza officials said at least 1,361 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have now been killed in the battered enclave. Israel has lost 56 soldiers to Gaza clashes and three civilians to Palestinian shelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Thursday, plumes of smoke could be seen rising above Gaza City following another night of airstrikes and heavy tank shelling by Israel.&#160;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound of explosions and planes flying overhead continued to be heard across the city as the sun rose.&#160;\r\n\r\n\r\nOvernight, several large explosions lit up the sky.&#160;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Israeli military said it is targeting Hamas command centers, rocket launchers and weapons arsenals.&#160;\r\n\r\n\r\nAttack on school condemned\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the United States and United Nations condemned the shelling by Israel of a U.N.-run school in Gaza that housed Palestinians seeking refuge, killing at least 15 people and wounding more than 100 early Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration condemned the school shelling, using tough, yet carefully worded language that reflects growing White House irritation with Israel and the mounting civilian casualties stemming from its ground and air war against Hamas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the U.S. is extremely concerned that thousands of Palestinian driven from their homes cannot find safety in U.N.-designated shelters. She also condemns those who hide weapons in those shelters.\r\n\r\n\r\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was incensed on Wednesday at the shelling of the U.N.-run school for Palestinians displaced by the fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is outrageous. It is unjustifiable. And it demands accountability and justice,” Ban said.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsrael said its forces were attacked by guerrillas near the school, in northern Jabalya, and had fired back.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt did not immediately comment on another incident, in nearby Shejaia, in which Palestinian officials said 17 people were killed by Israeli shelling near a produce market.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Such a massacre requires an earthquake-like response,” said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, whose group has kept up dozens of daily rocket launches deep into Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Israelis have kept casualties from the salvoes low with nine Iron Dome interceptor batteries and air-raid sirens that send people to shelters.\r\n\r\n\r\nRolling Israeli ground assaults on residential areas, prefaced by mass-warnings to evacuate, have displaced more than 200,000 of Gaza&#39;s 1.8 million Palestinians. The tiny territory&#39;s infrastructure is in ruin, with power and water outages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsrael says it is trying to avoid civilian casualties and blames these on Hamas and other Palestinian factions dug-in for urban combat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCease-fire negotiations\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth sides have voiced openness to a truce, but their terms diverge dramatically. Israel wants Gaza stripped of infiltration tunnels and rocket stocks. Hamas rules that out, and seeks an end to a crippling Gaza blockade enforced by Israel and Egypt, which view the Palestinian Islamists as a security threat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negotiations are further complicated by the fact Israel and the United States shun Hamas as a terrorist group, while the go-betweens - Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - disagree on Gaza policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a deal, Israel has ordered its ground forces to focus on locating and destroying a warren of tunnels with which Hamas has menaced its southern towns and army bases.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sami Turgeman, chief of Israeli forces in Gaza, said on Wednesday they were “but a few days away from destroying all the attack tunnels.” The army said 32 of the secret passages had been found so far and half of them blown up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Israeli soldiers were killed on Wednesday by a booby trap detonated as they uncovered a tunnel shaft, the army said. Military losses are more than five times those from the last Gaza ground war, in 2008-2009, but Israeli opinion polls show strong public support for fighting on until Hamas is quelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from abroad to stand down, however. The United States and the U.N. Security Council have urged an immediate, unconditional cease-fire by both sides in Gaza to allow in humanitarian relief and for further talks on a more durable cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparately, the Pentagon said it had allowed Israel to stock up on grenades and mortar rounds from a U.S. munitions store located in Israel as part of bilateral emergency preparedness arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome information for this report provided by Reuters, AFP and AP.",

Hamas rules that out, and seeks an end to a crippling Gaza blockade enforced by Israel and Egypt, which view the Palestinian Islamists as a security threat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negotiations are further complicated by the fact Israel and the United States shun Hamas as a terrorist group, while the go-betweens - Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - disagree on Gaza policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a deal, Israel has ordered its ground forces to focus on locating and destroying a warren of tunnels with which Hamas has menaced its southern towns and army bases.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sami Turgeman, chief of Israeli forces in Gaza, said on Wednesday they were “but a few days away from destroying all the attack tunnels.” The army said 32 of the secret passages had been found so far and half of them blown up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Israeli soldiers were killed on Wednesday by a booby trap detonated as they uncovered a tunnel shaft, the army said. Military losses are more than five times those from the last Gaza ground war, in 2008-2009, but Israeli opinion polls show strong public support for fighting on until Hamas is quelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from abroad to stand down, however. The United States and the U.N. Security Council have urged an immediate, unconditional cease-fire by both sides in Gaza to allow in humanitarian relief and for further talks on a more durable cessation of hostilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparately, the Pentagon said it had allowed Israel to stock up on grenades and mortar rounds from a U.S. munitions store located in Israel as part of bilateral emergency preparedness arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome information for this report provided by Reuters, AFP and AP.",

        "description": "In a recent blog post titled \"Attack on Gaza by Saudi Royal Appointment,\" David Hearst claims to have uncovered a secret alliance between Saudi Arabia and Israel on Gaza and Iran. He writes that the \"Saudi-Israeli alliance is forged in blood, Palestinian blood,\" and that the Israeli attack on Gaza came with \"royal appointment.\" \n\nHow does Hearst come to this conclusion?

        "title": "Ebola Outbreak Prompts Drastic Measures In Liberia",
        "description": "* Security forces ordered to impose strict measures * Isolation unit in capital overflowing * New isolation ward delayed by protests * Liberia faces \"humanitarian crisis\" - assistant minister * U.S. charity fighting virus withdraws non-essential staff * U.S. Peace Corps to withdraw volunteers from area (Adds details on plan as announced, details from NGO) By David Lewis and Emma Farge DAKAR, July 30 (Reuters) - Liberia will close schools and consider quarantining some communities, it said on Wednesday, announcing the toughest measures yet imposed by a West African government to halt the worst Ebola outbreak on record. Security forces in Liberia were ordered to enforce the steps, part of an action plan that includes placing all non-essential government workers on 30-day compulsory leave. Ebola has been blamed for 672 deaths in Liberia, neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to World Health Organization figures, as under-funded healthcare systems have struggled to cope with the epidemic. Liberia accounted for just under one-fifth of those deaths. \"This is a major public health emergency. It's fierce, deadly and many of our countrymen are dying and we need to act to stop the spread,\" Lewis Brown, Liberia's information minister, told Reuters. \"We need the support of the international community now more than ever. We desperately need all the help we can get.\" But highlighting international concern about the crisis, the U.S. Peace Corps said it was withdrawing 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said in a speech posted on the presidency's website that the government was considering quarantining several communities based on the recommendation of the health ministry. An earlier draft of the measures sent to Reuters specified communities to be quarantined. \"When these measures are instituted, only health care workers will be permitted to move in and out of those areas. Food and other medical support will be provided to those communities and affected individuals,\" she said. All markets in border areas are to be closed, she added. Referring to the orders issued to the security forces to impose the plan, Brown, the information minister, added: \"We are hoping there will be a level of understanding and that there will not be a need for exceptional force.\" Mike Noyes, head of humanitarian response at Action Aid UK, said people affected by Ebola should be treated with compassion rather than \"criminalized\". \"Enforced isolation of a whole community is a medieval approach to controlling the spread of disease,\" he said. The first cases of this outbreak were confirmed in Guinea's remote southeast in March. It then spread to the capital, Conakry, and into neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. Concern deepened last week when a Liberian-American died from Ebola in Nigeria having traveled from Liberia. Authorities in Nigeria, as well as Ghana and Togo, where he passed through en route to Lagos, are trying to trace passengers who were on the same plane as him. Some airlines in the region have cut routes to countries affected by Ebola despite the WHO saying it does not recommend travel restrictions as a step to control outbreaks. Britain on Wednesday held a top-level government meeting to discuss the spread of Ebola in West Africa, saying the outbreak was a threat it needed to respond to. A U.S. administration official said on Monday President Barack Obama was also monitoring the situation. OVERWHELMED Earlier on Wednesday, Liberian health officials said an isolation unit for Ebola victims in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, was overrun with cases and health workers are being forced to treat up to 20 new patients in their homes. Protests by the local community against the construction of a new isolation unit at Elwa Hospital have ended, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant minister of health, but patients with Ebola symptoms will have to wait at home until work is finished. \"The staff here are overwhelmed. This is a humanitarian crisis in Liberia,\" Nyenswah told Reuters by telephone. Nyenswah said the suspected patients were being treated by trained medical staff with full protective gear, but it would take at least 24-36 hours to build the new unit. Initial resistance to building a new isolation unit highlighted the fear and mistrust health workers have faced across West Africa as they battle the outbreak, which has strained the region's weak health systems. Dozens of local health workers - including Sierra Leone and Liberia's top two Ebola doctors - have died treating patients. Two Americans working for Samaritan's Purse, a U.S. charity operating in Liberia, were infected over the past week. Samaritan's Purse said on Wednesday that Kent Brantly, a doctor working for the charity, and Nancy Writebol, a colleague who was also volunteering in Liberia, had shown a slight improvement but their condition was still serious. However, the organization said that it would stop running case-management centers in Liberia after an attack on employees over the weekend and resistance from the local community to the expansion of their unit in Monrovia. The organization is withdrawing non-essential staff from the country, it added.

A U.S. administration official said on Monday President Barack Obama was also monitoring the situation.</br> <br/> <br>OVERWHELMED</br> <br>Earlier on Wednesday, Liberian health officials said an isolation unit for Ebola victims in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, was overrun with cases and health workers are being forced to treat up to 20 new patients in their homes.</br> <br>Protests by the local community against the construction of a new isolation unit at Elwa Hospital have ended, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant minister of health, but patients with Ebola symptoms will have to wait at home until work is finished.</br> <br>\"The staff here are overwhelmed. This is a humanitarian crisis in Liberia,\" Nyenswah told Reuters by telephone.</br> <br>Nyenswah said the suspected patients were being treated by trained medical staff with full protective gear, but it would take at least 24-36 hours to build the new unit.</br> <br>Initial resistance to building a new isolation unit highlighted the fear and mistrust health workers have faced across West Africa as they battle the outbreak, which has strained the region's weak health systems.</br> <br>Dozens of local health workers - including Sierra Leone and Liberia's top two Ebola doctors - have died treating patients. Two Americans working for Samaritan's Purse, a U.S. charity operating in Liberia, were infected over the past week.</br> <br>Samaritan's Purse said on Wednesday that Kent Brantly, a doctor working for the charity, and Nancy Writebol, a colleague who was also volunteering in Liberia, had shown a slight improvement but their condition was still serious.</br> <br>However, the organization said that it would stop running case-management centers in Liberia after an attack on employees over the weekend and resistance from the local community to the expansion of their unit in Monrovia. The organization is withdrawing non-essential staff from the country, it added.
